abstract = {We describe Bioconductor infrastructure for representing and computing on annotated genomic ranges and integrating genomic data with the statistical computing features of R and its extensions. At the core of the infrastructure are three packages: IRanges, GenomicRanges, and GenomicFeatures. These packages provide scalable data structures for representing annotated ranges on the genome, with special support for transcript structures, read alignments and coverage vectors. Computational facilities include efficient algorithms for overlap and nearest neighbor detection, coverage calculation and other range operations. This infrastructure directly supports more than 80 other Bioconductor packages, including those for sequence analysis, differential expression analysis and visualization.},

@article{Bailey2018,
abstract = {Identifying molecular cancer drivers is critical for precision oncology. Multiple advanced algorithms to identify drivers now exist, but systematic attempts to combine and optimize them on large datasets are few. We report a PanCancer and PanSoftware analysis spanning 9,423 tumor exomes (comprising all 33 of The Cancer Genome Atlas projects) and using 26 computational tools to catalog driver genes and mutations. We identify 299 driver genes with implications regarding their anatomical sites and cancer/cell types. Sequence- and structure-based analyses identified {\textgreater}3,400 putative missense driver mutations supported by multiple lines of evidence. Experimental validation confirmed 60{\%}–85{\%} of predicted mutations as likely drivers. We found that {\textgreater}300 MSI tumors are associated with high PD-1/PD-L1, and 57{\%} of tumors analyzed harbor putative clinically actionable events. Our study represents the most comprehensive discovery of cancer genes and mutations to date and will serve as a blueprint for future biological and clinical endeavors. A comprehensive analysis of oncogenic driver genes and mutations in {\textgreater}9,000 tumors across 33 cancer types highlights the prevalence of clinically actionable cancer driver events in TCGA tumor samples.},

@article{Hoadley2018,
abstract = {We conducted comprehensive integrative molecular analyses of the complete set of tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), consisting of approximately 10,000 specimens and representing 33 types of cancer. We performed molecular clustering using data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hypermethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin. The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development. Comprehensive, integrated molecular analysis identifies molecular relationships across a large diverse set of human cancers, suggesting future directions for exploring clinical actionability in cancer treatment.},

R and Bioconductor provide a generic framework for statistical analysis and visualization, as well as specialized data classes for a variety of high-throughput data types, but methods are lacking for integrative analysis of multi-omics experiments. The MultiAssayExperiment software package, implemented in R and leveraging Bioconductor software and design principles, provides for the coordinated representation of, storage of, and operation on multiple diverse genomics data. We provide all of the multiple 'omics data for each cancer tissue in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as ready-to-analyze MultiAssayExperiment objects, and demonstrate in these and other datasets how the software simplifies data representation, statistical analysis, and visualization. The MultiAssayExperiment Bioconductor package reduces major obstacles to efficient, scalable and reproducible statistical analysis of multi-omics data and enhances data science applications of multiple omics datasets.},

@article{Darmanis2017,
abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and is notoriously difficult to treat because of its diffuse nature. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3,589 cells in a cohort of four patients. We obtained cells from the tumor core as well as surrounding peripheral tissue. Our analysis revealed cellular variation in the tumor's genome and transcriptome. We were also able to identify infiltrating neoplastic cells in regions peripheral to the core lesions. Despite the existence of significant heterogeneity among neoplastic cells, we found that infiltrating GBM cells share a consistent gene signature between patients, suggesting a common mechanism of infiltration. Additionally, in investigating the immunological response to the tumors, we found transcriptionally distinct myeloid cell populations residing in the tumor core and the surrounding peritumoral space. Our data provide a detailed dissection of GBM cell types, revealing an abundance of information about tumor formation and migration. Darmanis et al. perform single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neoplastic and stromal cells within and proximal to primary glioblastomas. The authors describe a population of neoplastic-infiltrating glioblastoma cells as well as a putative role of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in supporting tumor growth.},

@article{Millard2011,
abstract = {Whereas genomic data are universally machine-readable, data from imaging, multiplex biochemistry, flow cytometry and other cell- and tissue-based assays usually reside in loosely organized files of poorly documented provenance. This arises because the relational databases used in genomic research are difficult to adapt to rapidly evolving experimental designs, data formats and analytic algorithms. Here we describe an adaptive approach to managing experimental data based on semantically typed data hypercubes (SDCubes) that combine hierarchical data format 5 (HDF5) and extensible markup language (XML) file types. We demonstrate the application of SDCube-based storage using ImageRail, a software package for high-throughput microscopy. Experimental design and its day-to-day evolution, not rigid standards, determine how ImageRail data are organized in SDCubes. We applied ImageRail to collect and analyze drug dose-response landscapes in human cell lines at single-cell resolution.},

abstract = {Characterizing the transcriptome of individual cells is fundamental to understanding complex biological systems. We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ mRNA counting of up to tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation in droplets takes place in {\~{}}6 minutes, with {\~{}}50{\%} cell capture efficiency, up to 8 samples at a time. The speed and efficiency allow the processing of precious samples while minimizing stress to cells. To demonstrate the system′s technical performance and its applications, we collected transcriptome data from {\~{}}¼ million single cells across 29 samples. First, we validate the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. Then, we profile 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to demonstrate the system′s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we use sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single cell resolution in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of transplant patients. This analysis enables characterization of the complex interplay between donor and host cells and monitoring of treatment response. This high-throughput system is robust and enables characterization of diverse biological systems with single cell mRNA analysis.},
